# clustermax
A Stata command to select a maximum number of distance-buffered clusters from point coordinates.

## Description
The clustermax command is an algorithm to find the maximum number of clusters from a given set of point coordinates and user-selected cluster characteristics: the minimum distance between any two points from different clusters, the maximum distance between any two points in the same cluster, and the minimum number of points per cluster.
